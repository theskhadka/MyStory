Once there was a lion and a mouse.
One day the lion was sleeping.
In the jungle, a little mouse came and started jumping on the lion's back.
The lion woke up and got angry at the mouse.
The lion chased the mouse and got the mouse.
The mouse pleaded for the lion to let him go and said that he would owe him a favor.
